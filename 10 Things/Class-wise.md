A program is a set of instructions given to a computer to make it do something.

Names of popular programming languages: C, C++, Java, Python, Ruby, R, JavaScript, Scala, Go, Lua, Kotlin, Rust

Examples of programs vs. not programs such as web sites, native apps.

hardware, OS, application software

Examples of OS

RAM vs. hard disk
function of the RAM - whatever happens, happens inside the RAM. When the program exits, the program goes away from the RAM.

Functions of an OS -- when we launch a program, it begins executing it. It creates memory inside the RAM.

CUI vs. GUI OS, the shell -- explorer (GUI) vs. cmd or the command prompt (CUI). Teach a few cmd commands.

Tools to write a program in any programming language.
Editor
Compiler
Runtime: requests memory from the OS, manages the memory given by the OS to it.
Show for e.g. the VC++ runtime DLL, the VC++ compiler, any editor.
Same for Visual Basic.

Examples of editors: notepad, notepad++, sublime, atom.

Same for C# -- location of C# compiler csc.exe, CLR (the Common Language Runtime) is a lot of libraries in the GAC

Why the name CLR. What was Microsoft's goal in creating CLR and C#?

C#'s similarity to Java. But C# is way more advanced than Java.

Brace styles don't matter. Pick yours. Best go by whatever the majority in the language follow.

Variables. Static and strong typing.

Printing and reading from the console.
