### CLASS 1

A program is a set of instructions given to a computer to make it do something.

Names of popular programming languages: C, C++, Java, Python, Ruby, R, JavaScript, Scala, Go, Lua, Kotlin, Rust

Examples of programs vs. not programs such as web sites, native apps.

hardware, OS, application software

Examples of OS

RAM vs. hard disk
function of the RAM - whatever happens, happens inside the RAM. When the program exits, the program goes away from the RAM.

Functions of an OS -- when we launch a program, it begins executing it. It creates memory inside the RAM.

### CLASS 2

CUI vs. GUI OS, the shell -- explorer (GUI) vs. cmd or the command prompt (CUI). Teach a few cmd commands.

Tools to write a program in any programming language.
Editor
Compiler
Runtime: requests memory from the OS, manages the memory given by the OS to it.
Show for e.g. the VC++ runtime DLL, the VC++ compiler, any editor.
Same for Visual Basic.

Examples of editors: notepad, notepad++, sublime, atom.

Same for C# -- location of C# compiler csc.exe, CLR (the Common Language Runtime) is a lot of libraries in the GAC

Adding the C# compiler csc.exe to your PATH until we learn about IDE's.

Why the name CLR. What was Microsoft's goal in creating CLR and C#?

.NET Framework: compilers, CLR, libraries

C#'s similarity to Java. But C# is way more advanced than Java.

Brace styles don't matter. Pick yours. Best go by whatever the majority in the language follow.

.NET Framework versions. C# versions.

Variables. Static and strong typing.

Basic data types without going into details about their sizes and ranges.
String
int
double
bool

null

Printing and reading from the console.
Checking if a string is null or empty

Some functions to work with:
1. Console.Write
2. Console.WriteLine
3. Console.ReadLine
5. string.IsNullOrEmpty
6. int.ParseInt

Assignment operator
Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, \\, % and their assignment operators like +=, etc.)
Pre and post increment and decrement operators
Comparison operators (>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=)
Logical operators (AND, OR)

if construct, else, elseif
switch case
while
do while
for loop

#### Classroom exercises:

##### Printing on and reading from the screen, string.IsNullOrEmpty, int.ParseInt, if construct, for loop
1. Ask a person their name and age and print it out on the screen.
2. Ask a person their name and age. If the name they enter is blank, then tell them and exit the program. If they enter an age less than 10 or more than 120, display an error and exit. If they're older than 18, print they are of the age of majority, otherwise print they are a minor.
3. Ask a person their name and age and keep asking them for their name until they print a non-blank value. Similarly, keep asking for an age until they print one between 10 and 120.
4. Print numbers from 1 to 25, one on each line.
5. Print numbers from 1 to 25 with a comma in between each and a full-stop after the last one.
6. Ask the user for his or her name and print, "Hello, <Name>!" where <Name> is the user's name.
7.
