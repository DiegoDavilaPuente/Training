This folder contains the slides and the code written by Robert B. Francis and used in his presentation titled, "Introduction to MSBuild." A video recording of the presentation may be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8bmw5zBZZI

I obtained this material via an email communication with him. His email is provided at the end of the video.
